# LANDING-PAGE
Hello everyone, if youre viewing this, i successfully completed this landing page. Ha!
I saw this landing page on youtube and decided to recreate it using some images from previously completed frontend mentor challenge. 
What i especially like about it is the dark/light mode courtesy javascript.
This project introduced me to an aspect of css(clip-path) as well as javacript that is entirely new to me.
it required the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

i am still a budding webdeveloper, but im always excited to try new challenges, implement codes and recreate designs.
