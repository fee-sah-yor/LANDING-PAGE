#Interior Design LANDING-PAGE
Featuring: Light and Dark Mode
This project introduced me to an aspect of css(clip-path) that is entirely new to me.
i was not able to successfully translate the hamburger menu, the third line that stays after clicking the menu.
if you have any suggestions on how to remove it, i would gladly take it.

i am still a budding webdeveloper, but im always excited to try new challenges, implement codes and recreate designs.
